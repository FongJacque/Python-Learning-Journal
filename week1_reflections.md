###### Version 1.0

Topics covered between January 27 through February 2
======
1. Core Object-Oriented Programming concepts, such as hierarchy of classes and descriptions

Valuable takeaways
======
* I had not installed VS Code into my new school computers, so I had to go back and research how to set up everything as it has been over 6 months since I have last coded outside of Jupyter. I previously enjoyed using VS Code, as the design is more visually, beneficial for me as I am not confident in my coding. I need to take some extra time to review the differences between C++ and Python, as I am concurrently taking both courses. I can read the code, but a majority of the practices are scrambled.
* Review terminology, concepts are understood, but not memorized, such as parent-sibling classes (not sister classes)

Future plans
======
1. Create individual cheatsheets of syntax and basic structure of code for both C++ and Python, for reference, to mitigate confusion.
2. Look forther into VS Code capabilities and format it best to be successful
   * Learn to set up and use multiple terminals
