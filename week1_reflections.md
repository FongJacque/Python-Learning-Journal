###### Version 1.1

Topics covered between January 27 through February 2
======
1. Core Object-Oriented Programming concepts, such as hierarchy of classes and descriptions
2. Demo'ed basic class and object construction
3. Overview on data structures and different types of data structures
4. Explained difference between public and private variables, and how python handles these variables differently from other programming languages
5. Explained the relevance of algorithms and associated data structures to more efficiently develop and utilize code

Valuable takeaways
======
* I had not installed VS Code into my new school computers, so I had to go back and research how to set up everything as it has been over 6 months since I have last coded outside of Jupyter. I previously enjoyed using VS Code, as the design is more visually, beneficial for me as I am not confident in my coding. I need to take some extra time to review the differences between C++ and Python, as I am concurrently taking both courses. I can read the code, but a majority of the practices are scrambled.
* Review terminology, concepts are understood, but not memorized, such as parent-sibling classes (not sister classes)
* Understand differences between different data structures and their preferred use cases
* Python handles types dynamically, so types do not need to be called, resulting in flexible code
* Objects are automatically deleted when not referenced, opposed to C++, where it must be explicitly called.

Future plans
======
1. Create individual cheatsheets of syntax and basic structure of code for both C++ and Python, for reference, to mitigate confusion.
2. Look forther into VS Code capabilities and format it best to be successful
   * Learn to set up and utilize multiple terminals efficiently (if necessary)
3. Create flashcards regarding different data structure types
