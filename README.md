# Python-Learning-Journal
A repository to document my Python learning journey

About Me
======
I was born and raised in California. I am a US Army veteran, classically trained chef from Le Cordon Bleu, private military contractor, and private security contractor. I am not a student, aiming to pursue my education in Statistics and Data Science, with the goal of transitioning to the tech sector. I found a love of data analytics while enlisted, and wish to transition that to a permanent career.
Outside of my work history, I dabble with a variety of hobbies, from bouldering, crocheting, learning new instruments, and learning new languages. I try to find different mediums to extract data from to better optimize my own growth. I am never against trying and learning new things, as life is supposed to be an experience.

Goals for This Course
======
I wish to further expand my knowledge of Python, as it is beneficial to my development within the data science field. Through the structure of a class, I hope to be able to portion out work more appropriately and receive feedback to better develop as a coder. In addition, as I will be transfering in Fall 2025, I want to extract as much information and insight as I can from various other sources, be it classmates to instructors, as I have already transitioned career fields three times now.

My First Python Program

Programs produced during the semester
