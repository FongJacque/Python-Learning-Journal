A repository to document my Python learning journey

# About Me
Born and raised in the Bay Area. Served with the US army for 9 years. Classically trained chef from Le Cordon Bleu, San Francisco. Pursuing a degree in Statistics/Data Science.

# Goals for This Course
I wish to further expand my knowledge of Python, as it is beneficial to my development within the data science field. Through the structure of a class, I hope to be able to portion out work more appropriately and receive feedback to better develop as a coder.

# My First Python Program
